Project Title:

       Fraud Detection In Insurance Claims Using 
                                 Decision Trees
PROBLEM  STATEMENT:

Insurance companies face significant financial losses due to fraudulent claims, which can impact their profitability and reputation. Detecting fraudulent claims accurately and efficiently is crucial for maintaining the integrity of insurance operations.
PROJECT   OVERVIEW:
  Gather a dataset containing information about past insurance claims, including fraudulent cases. This dataset should encompass various attributes such as claim amount, policyholder details, claim history, etc.
YOUR SOLUTION AND ITS VALUE PROPOSITION
In fraud detection within insurance claims using decision trees, our solution brings forth a compelling set of value propositions tailored to address the intricate challenges faced by insurance companies.
MODELLING
1. Data Preparation:
   - Collect and preprocess historical insurance claims data, including cleaning,   
      handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling   
      numerical features.
2. Feature Selection:
   - Select relevant features that may indicate fraudulent behavior, such as claim 
      amount, policyholder information, claim history, etc. Use techniques like correlation 
      analysis and feature importance from decision trees to prioritize features.
3. Model Training:
   - Train a decision tree classifier using the preprocessed data. Decision trees 
      recursively split the data based on feature values, creating a tree-like structure of   
      decisions.
RESULTS
In fraud detection in insurance claims using decision trees, the results have been highly promising. By leveraging decision tree models, insurance companies have achieved significant advancements in their ability to detect and prevent fraudulent activities within their claims process
